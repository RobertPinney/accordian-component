Created in React, this program is comprised of only one component, a collapsable accordian style question/answer component.

This was built under the guidance of the Jonas Schmedtmann Ultimate React Course (Udemy).

This program was useful for teaching me when and where to use state, to lift state, and to know when to use derived state.
